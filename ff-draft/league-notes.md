# All's Well That Ends Wells — League Notes

## In-season (Sept 15 2026, post-Week 1) — read this first

- **Three separate dollar figures now in play, don't conflate them:**
  1. **$100** real-money buy-in (season-long, into the payout pot).
  2. **$200** auction draft budget (spent, draft night only).
  3. **$100 season-long FAAB waiver budget** — confirmed by Alex directly,
     for the whole season's waiver claims. See `rosters.md` for current
     roster state and the waiver-report workflow below.
- **Team names can drift from draft night** — Alex's team was "Purdy Flowers
  for the King" at the draft, is **"Allen-ine Fannin Mutants"** now. Check
  `rosters.md` for current names, not this file's older references.
- **Owner waiver-activity tiers** (Alex's read, for gauging bid competition):
  **High** — Joe, Hai, Kyle (active on waivers, bid aggressively). **Mid** —
  OJ, Sara. **Low** — Zach, Steph (rarely active). Use this to judge how much
  competition/FAAB pressure to expect on a given claim.
- **Weekly waiver-report workflow**: Alex feeds roster changes (or a fresh
  roster paste) each week; a report gets built targeting his team's actual
  needs against public waiver-wire research, sized to his $100 season FAAB
  pool. See `waiver-reports/` for the format and examples. Email delivery
  deliberately not wired up yet — nailing the report content first.


Source: Alex's Gmail (commissioner threads), pulled Aug 31, 2026. Google Drive
could not be searched this session (the connected Drive tool only exposes
share/trash/update — no search or file-read), so none of the historical
draft-sheet spreadsheets Alex mentioned were reachable. Everything below is
sourced from email only. Anything not directly stated in an email is marked
**unconfirmed**.

## Snapshot

- **League**: All's Well That Ends Wells (Yahoo Fantasy Football), running 12+ years.
- **Format**: 8 teams, auction draft (confirmed live — Joe's email about
  "speed up the clock for choosing players and time to bid" during the 2026
  scheduling thread), $100 buy-in per team. Draft type in Yahoo is set to
  "offline" — the league drafts live over Zoom and picks get entered into
  Yahoo afterward/alongside, not run through Yahoo's live draft room.
- **2026 draft**: Tuesday, Sept 1, 2026, **8:30pm–10:00pm PDT**, over Zoom —
  confirmed directly against Alex's Google Calendar event ("Wells Fantasy
  Football Draft," last updated Aug 31 16:59 UTC), which everyone accepted.
  **Yahoo's own reminder emails have it at 8:30am** — Kyle flagged this
  mismatch and it was never addressed in the email thread. The calendar/Zoom
  time (8:30pm) is the real plan; Yahoo's in-system draft time is the thing
  that's wrong and worth fixing before tomorrow so it doesn't confuse anyone
  checking Yahoo directly (and so Yahoo doesn't auto-start anything at 8:30am).
- **Buy-in vs. auction budget — two different numbers**: the **$100 buy-in**
  is real cash into the league pot (confirmed by email, see below). The
  **auction draft budget is $200/team** in fake Yahoo dollars used for
  bidding — per Alex directly, not found in any email (Yahoo's stock
  default is $200 regardless of the real buy-in, so this tracks). The draft
  board tool uses $200/team; don't confuse it with the $100 real-money buy-in
  below.
- **Buy-in**: $100/team, confirmed unchanged for 2026 (Alex considered a raise
  to $150, group pushback, decision was to hold at $100).
- **New 2026 rule**: $5 into the pot for every starting roster spot filled by
  a player who doesn't take the field that week (bye, inactive, ruled out —
  no exceptions). Alex's words: "Extra cash sweetens the pot and gets
  distributed on the usual splits" — the actual payout split percentages
  were never stated in any thread found. **Unconfirmed** — needs a direct
  answer from Alex or a look at the Yahoo league's payout settings.
- **Roster — starters CONFIRMED** (Yahoo Commissioner tools, Sept 1 2026):
  1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, **2 W/R/T flex** (RB/WR/TE-eligible), 1 K, 1 D/ST =
  **10 starters**. No superflex (Q/W/R/T = 0), no IDP, no OP. This matches
  Alex's 2020–2024 "FF Draft Analysis" sheets (Google Drive → Fantasy
  Football/) exactly and supersedes the 2017 no-K/DEF signal. **Bench count
  still unconfirmed** from Yahoo — the sheets assume 7 (→ 17 total, $180
  starter / $20 bench convention). Draft-board tool defaults to 16; set to
  starters + bench once bench is known.
- Because both flex slots are RB/WR/TE, a build can run 3 RB + 3 WR + 2 TE
  across the flexes — no forced positional split beyond the 2/2/1 minimums.
- **Scoring — CONFIRMED custom (Yahoo settings screenshots, Sept 1 2026)**:
  PPR (1 per reception) **plus stacking yardage bonuses**, all toggled on:
  - Passing yards: +5 at 300, +5 at 400, +5 at 500 (cumulative — a 500-yd
    game = +15 on top of base).
  - Rushing yards: +5 at 100, +5 at 200, +5 at 300 (cumulative).
  - Receiving yards: +5 at 100, +5 at 200, +5 at 300 (cumulative).
  Base rates not shown on that screen but assume Yahoo standard (1/25 pass,
  1/10 rush-rec, 4 pass TD, 6 rush/rec TD). These bonuses reward ceiling /
  explosiveness and elite + dual-threat QBs — see the draft implications in
  `value-sources.md`. FantasyPros/ESPN values do **not** bake these in.

## Roster shape — historical signal (not confirmed current)

Found one more useful thread: this league's Yahoo predecessor ("Jim Wells in
the Fist Round," 2017 — Alex became commissioner of the renamed "All's Wells
that ends Wells" in 2020 per a Yahoo transfer-of-commissioner email) shows
actual settings-change notifications:

- **Starting lineup (2017)**: QB, WR, WR, RB, RB, TE, W/R/T — 7 starters, one
  flex, **no kicker or defense** in the starters list shown.
- **Draft type**: "Live Auction" confirmed in multiple settings emails across
  2018–2019, consistent with what's used today.
- **Scoring categories** included Rec (receptions are scored — consistent
  with PPR) alongside standard yard/TD categories, but the actual point
  value per reception was never shown in any snippet pulled.
- Team count fluctuated year to year in this history (10 → 8 → 10 → 8, per
  various settings-change emails) before settling at 8 for the current era.

Treat this as a strong directional signal (auction, PPR-flavored, flex-heavy,
historically no K/DEF) rather than confirmed 2026 settings — 9 years old and
roster construction could have changed since. `draft-board.html` still
defaults to a generic 16-spot roster; if the league in fact carries no
K/DEF, drop the K/DEF rows out of the Bid Sheet tab and adjust the roster
count down.

## Owners (8 teams)

## Standing traditions / league lore

- **2025 champion**: Alex ("Purdy Flowers for the King" 🏆). Went back-to-back
  as of the 2026 roll-call email.
- **Toilet Bowl**: last-place bracket/punishment. Zach finished last
  back-to-back and owes the league a repeat "beer mile" — Alex sent him a
  shirt for it ("hoping you got the shirt I sent you. We're looking forward
  to your run."). Steph has volunteered to film it, again.
- League has held the same 8-person crew for years; Alex's roll-call emails
  lean on that loyalty ("don't be the one who bails").

## Open threads worth resolving before draft night

1. **Yahoo's draft-time setting still says 8:30am** (confirmed wrong — the
   real draft is 8:30pm–10pm PDT per the Zoom calendar invite everyone
   accepted). Kyle caught this Aug 31; worth fixing in Yahoo before tomorrow
   so the league site and reminders match reality.
2. **Snake vs. auction** — Steph asked "Anyone open to doing a snake draft
   this year?" in the final scheduling thread; no reply on record. Joe's
   "speed up the clock... time to bid" reply (sent before Steph's question)
   implies the league is defaulting to auction as usual, but this was never
   explicitly re-confirmed after Steph's question.
3. **Payout split percentages** — referenced as "the usual splits" but the
   actual numbers were not found in any searched thread.
4. **Roster/scoring settings** — not confirmed; needed to make the draft
   board's roster-spot math (currently a 16-slot placeholder) accurate.

## What would sharpen this

- Drive access with real read/search (currently only share/trash/update are
  exposed) to pull the historical draft sheets Alex mentioned — those would
  let auction values actually be calibrated to this league's real bidding
  history instead of rescaled industry consensus.
- The Yahoo league's settings page/export for scoring and roster rules.
- Confirmation of the payout split.
